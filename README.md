back log issues
==========


1. There needs to be data for family size greater than 3.
3. When a family is in the upper end of the 9.5% bracket. I need to make an adjustment so they drop one more bracket to the 8.05% rate.
4. There needs to be formatting on the numbers.
5. I need to add age range of primary.
6. I need to add region.
7. I'm going to need to change the file names to something that mean something to a tax person or the person who will maintain the thing will be lost next year.
9. If AGI is less than 100% then we need something that says “MediCaid Eligible”

8. change family slider to drop down

2. There is an error when you select a family size and you select an AGI which isn't in the table (i.e. They're at the 100% rate). I also would think you would want the reduction to bring them down to the 9.5% rate.
